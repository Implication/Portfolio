            <p>I am a Web Developer with a degree in Computer Science that is currently seeking to get my foot into the
                door of Web Development. I am self taught in all web languages with experience building websies in
                front-end and
                back-end, using NODEJS, REACT, MONGODB, and EXPRESS for functionality, while using Bootstrap
                for creating responsive UI Designs. My essential skill sets above all else are perserverance,
                organization, and adaptability.

        <div class="card card-body py-5">
            <h3><strong>Education</strong></h3>
            <p>I graduated in May 2018 with a degree in Computer Science. Some of the highlights for me include
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    2 Mobile Development projects while working in teams using SDLC principles
                </li>
                <li>
                    Using Networking Principles to create asyncronous projects that interact in real time with file
                    input based on networking principles
                </li>
                <li>
                    I learned about OS in linux, creating stream projects in c++ that transferred files
                </li>
                <li>
                    I learned about how a compiler works, creating my own compiler in a group of three using the c++
                    language
                </li>
                <li>
                    I learned about algorithms and data structures, and use these as the core principles in order to
                    create the web projects that I work on today
                </li>
            </ul>
            Above all these, however, the most important skill that I have learned through college and what started my
            real journey is learning how to learn effectively and quickly
        </div>
        <div class="card card-body py-5">
            <h3><strong>My Journey/Road</strong></h3>
            <p>After Graduating I started to look for jobs around my area, quickly realizing that I had learned the
                wrong skill set, and needed to start to
                learn industry languages, and quickly if I was ever going to land a job without signing up to a
                bootcamp. So taking my only option at the time,
                I started to work for an Amazon Fullfillment Center
            </p>
            <h5><strong>Why so long?</strong></h5>
            <p>At the time, I needed money, as well as the fact that I could not go through tutoring myself at the time,
                due to complications that were occuring in my life
                preventing me from being able to confortably learn the technologies needed to get through the materials
                needed. Eventually complications came from the job
                preventing me from being able to work through what I wanted to do due to the long hours of work that are
                needed in order for Amazon to sucessfully fullfil orders
                for their customers. From being on and off, I was slowly but surely learning the fundamentals of web
                development, starting and stopping with HTML CSS, and Javascript.
                Eventually almost all together giving up for a time settling in to what my life became.
            </p>
            <p>I started to long to want to work again in the field that I enjoy myself being in since being a kid. I
                unfortunately did not have the story of coding since I was five.
                I grew up in a low income home; many oppurtunities were not afforded to me until it was to late. I do
                not regret any decisions that I have
                made, I can only look at the present to make a better decision in the current moment then the decisions
                that I made in te past.
            </p>

        <div class="card card-body py-5">
            <h3><strong>Now were here</strong></h3>
            <p>
                Now I am in a state of mind that is once again hungry and driven to succeed for myself. My only goal
                right now is to be able to finally land myself in a career as
                a Web developer, and finally be able to say that I made it into the industry

                <h3>Barchats</h3>
                <p>This is a podcast website of the podcast barchats that I created from a request made by my brother
                    who needed a site that users can go to to consume the episodes of the podcast as well as have links
                    to other media outlets that the podcast is a part of. The main highlight for me in this website is
                    using itunes API in order to fetch episode from the rss feed provided by buzzsprouts. I then use the
                    rss feed that they provide and convert it into a readable json format using feednami, and parse the
                    episodes out into the episode section. The technologies that I use for the project so far as HTML,
                    CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap. In the future as their podcast grows, eventually this may need an
                    upgrade in th elanguages that are currently being used in order to prepare for scalability, so
                    behind the scenes I set up a CMS known as siteleaf in the event that they want to eventually publish
                    their own content onto the site.</p>

                <p>This is an information/entertainment website on the league of legends champion ekko, which i made
                    solely because of my love for the game and my love for playing this champion. I did not make this as
                    a intention of a guide for the champion but rather to inform users on basic setup during the current
                    time of what are the best runes to take according to credible sources, his abilities and my own
                    showcasing of feats that he is capable of when the champion is played at the highest levels. The
                    main purpose of this was to learn and understand react at a fundamental level.</p>

                <h3>Superhero Fight</h3>
                <p>This was a project that I made when learning the fundamentals of node, express, and template boiler
                    coding, hence why the site is simple in mind, my main goals of this site were to understand how to
                    make request to an API client, how routing works, how templating works, and to render the data or
                    results onto the browser without using a front end library such as react to keep the state of the
                    data.</p>
                <p>The API however has some limitations and some problems that I put some workaround for, firstly, I
                    created my own JSON object file in order to get the names of all the superheroes, since the
                    superhero api does not provide a list that is readily avaliable for people to use.</p>
                <p>Secondly and what I found out later as I was making the code, the people making some of the values
                    were extremely lazy and hard coded the value of null to certain heroes, so I Decided to replace this
                    with N/A</p>
                <p>This can easily be improved upon to create more routes that interact with the API, and even improve
                    upon the results table to show the values in a better fashion, but as it is, it gets the point
                    across.</p>
                <p>For this project I used HTML, CSS Javascript, NODEJS, Bootstrap, Express, and EJS, all data that is
                    shown after entering the hero names comes from the Superhero API which can be found <a
